# TODO
- [x] All measurements are to 1 decimal place
- [x] Bigger, bolder font for the chart titles
- [x] Rain is a bar chart with 7 daily min, max and mean values and an hourly curve
- [x] Temperature is a bar chart 7 with daily min, max and mean values and an hourly curve
- [x] Relative humidity daily bar 1 bar for 7 days
- [x] Wind speed and atmospheric pressure should be weekly
- [ ] Wind direction should take the hourly [circular mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_mean) of the values. Maybe 7 curves for the week
- [x] Replace "soil moisture" with "volumetric water content"
- [x] Plot 3 temperatures on each graph (6 graphs in total)
- [x] Autoscale the volumetric water content graphs
- [x] Volumetric water content graph titles should read sensor 1, sensor 2, ...
- [x] Wind dir -> Wind direction
- [x] Average humidity -> Relative humidity
- [x] Power -> Data logger power
- [x] Average temp -> temperature
- [x] Average total radiation -> Total radiation
- [x] Diffuse radiation -> Diffuse radiation 
- [x] Just have daily evapotranspiration (get rid of the other 2)
- [x] Get rid of radiation plots entirely, get rid of power
- [x] Add max and min temperature as column in the database
- [x] Get rid of sunshine
- [x] Add compass directions for wind direction
